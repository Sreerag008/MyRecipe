            <p>Ingredients:
                <ul>
                <li>12 ounces (340g) spaghetti</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or Parmesan)</li>
                <li>4 ounces (113g) pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li> Salt</li>
                <li>Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)</li>
                </ul>
                
                Instructions:
                <ol>
                <li>                Start by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes).
                </li>
                <li>                While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale to the skillet and cook it until it becomes crispy and golden brown. Remove from heat and set it aside.
                </li>
                <li>                In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese until well combined. Season with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Be careful with adding additional salt, as both the pancetta and cheese are already salty.
                </li>
                <li>                When the pasta is cooked, use a pair of tongs to transfer it directly from the pot to the skillet with the crispy pancetta (don't drain the pasta too thoroughly, as a little pasta water helps create a creamy sauce). Toss the pasta and pancetta together to coat the pasta evenly with the rendered fat from the pancetta.
                </li>
                <li>                Remove the skillet from heat, and while it's still hot, quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta. Toss everything together vigorously, so the eggs and cheese create a creamy sauce that coats the pasta. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a bit of pasta water to loosen it.
                </li>
                <li>                Serve the Spaghetti Carbonara immediately, garnished with more freshly ground black pepper and chopped fresh parsley if desired.
                </li>        
            </ol>    
                Enjoy your homemade Spaghetti Carbonara! It's a rich and satisfying pasta dish that's sure to be a crowd-pleaser.
